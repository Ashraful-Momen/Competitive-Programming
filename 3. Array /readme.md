To **master arrays** from **zero to advanced**, you need to build a solid foundation of basic operations first and then gradually tackle more complex problem-solving patterns. Here’s a full **step-by-step roadmap** with **problem types and algorithms** that you must cover:

---

## ✅ **Basic Level (Foundation Building)**

Learn the fundamentals first.

### 📌 **Operations**

* Traversal
* Insert (beginning, middle, end)
* Delete by index/value
* Update/replace value
* Reverse an array

### 📌 **Basic Problems**

1. Find the minimum and maximum element
2. Search (Linear Search, Binary Search if sorted)
3. Count occurrences of an element
4. Check if the array is sorted
5. Sum of all elements
6. Merge two arrays (new array or in-place)
7. Rotate array (left/right by 1 or k steps)

---

## ✅ **Intermediate Level (Patterns and Techniques)**

### 🔁 **Patterns**

* **Two Pointers Technique**
* **Sliding Window**
* **Prefix Sum**
* **Hashing / Frequency Array**

### 📌 **Problem Types**

1. **Duplicate elements**

   * Remove duplicates from sorted/unsorted array
   * Find the first duplicate
2. **Sorting**

   * Bubble / Selection / Insertion (basic)
   * Quick sort / Merge sort (advanced prep)
3. **Searching**

   * Binary search (with variations)
   * Search in rotated sorted array
4. **Subarrays**

   * Max/min sum subarray (Kadane’s algorithm)
   * Fixed-size window sum
   * Count of subarrays with a given sum
5. **Prefix Sum Use-Cases**

   * Range sum queries
   * Equilibrium index
   * Partition array problems

---

## ✅ **Advanced Level (Algorithmic Mastery)**

### ⚙️ **Core Algorithms**

* Kadane’s Algorithm (max subarray sum)
* Dutch National Flag Algorithm (3-way partition)
* Mo’s Algorithm (range queries)
* Merge Intervals
* Binary Search on Answer (upper bound problems)
* Monotonic Stack (for Next Greater/Smaller problems)

### 📌 **Advanced Problem Types**

1. Trapping Rain Water
2. Maximum Product Subarray
3. Longest Consecutive Subsequence
4. Subarrays with XOR = k
5. Minimum swaps to sort array
6. Rotate matrix (2D array)
7. Find all leaders in array
8. Next Greater Element (with stack)
9. Sliding Window Maximum (Deque)
10. Count Inversions (using merge sort)

---

## ✅ **2D Arrays & Matrix Level**

Once you're good with 1D arrays.

### 📌 **Topics**

* Transpose matrix
* Spiral print
* Search in sorted matrix
* Rotate 90 degrees
* Matrix multiplication

---

## ✅ **Preparation Strategy**

### 🔧 Tools

* Practice platforms: **LeetCode, Codeforces, HackerRank**
* Track progress using spreadsheets or GitHub notes.

### 🧠 Tip:

> Solve **each type of problem** in **3 difficulties**: easy, medium, and hard. That ensures mastery.
