Hereâ€™s a **complete list of topics** to **master arrays in C++**, organized in a progressive orderâ€”from beginner to advanced.

---

### ðŸŸ¢ **1. Basics of Arrays**

* Array declaration and initialization
* Accessing elements
* Traversal (loops)
* Multi-dimensional arrays
* Character arrays and strings

---

### ðŸŸ¡ **2. Array Operations**

* Insertion (at beginning, middle, end)
* Deletion (by index or value)
* Searching (linear & binary search)
* Sorting (bubble, selection, insertion, quicksort)
* Reversing an array
* Shifting & rotating arrays (left/right)
* Frequency count of elements
* Merging two arrays

---

### ðŸŸ  **3. Pointer and Memory Concepts**

* Arrays and pointers (decay to pointer)
* Pointer arithmetic
* Dynamic memory allocation (`new[]`, `delete[]`)
* Arrays in functions (pass by pointer/reference)
* 2D dynamic arrays (`int**` with `new`)
* Memory layout and stack vs heap arrays

---

### ðŸ”µ **4. STL Array Containers**

* `std::array` (fixed-size, type-safe)
* `std::vector` (dynamic, powerful)

  * `push_back`, `resize`, `insert`, `erase`, `capacity` vs `size`
* `std::deque` (double-ended array)
* Iterators and ranged-for loops
* Sorting using `std::sort`, `std::stable_sort`

---

### ðŸ”´ **5. Intermediate Algorithms with Arrays**

* Prefix sum
* Sliding window technique
* Two-pointer technique
* Kadane's Algorithm (max subarray sum)
* Binary search on arrays
* Difference array technique
* Rearranging arrays (positive-negative, even-odd)

---

### ðŸŸ£ **6. Problem-Solving Topics**

* Remove duplicates
* Find missing numbers
* Find duplicates (with/without extra space)
* Count inversions
* Rotate matrix (90/180 degrees)
* Spiral order traversal
* Subarrays with sum = K
* Equilibrium index
* Trapping rainwater
* Merge sorted arrays in-place

---

### âš« **7. Advanced Topics**

* Bit manipulation with arrays
* Sparse arrays & frequency maps
* Custom comparator with `std::sort`
* Arrays of objects & structures
* Cache optimization and memory alignment
* Memory leaks & debugging dynamic arrays

---

### ðŸŸ¤ **8. Multi-dimensional & Complex Structures**

* 2D arrays
* 3D arrays
* Jagged arrays
* Arrays of pointers
* Matrix multiplication
* Flood fill (DFS/BFS on 2D arrays)
