Perfect ðŸ‘Œ Letâ€™s go **line by line** through your C++ code and explain what happens, including the output.

### âœ… Code Walkthrough

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
```

* `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` â†’ includes **all standard C++ libraries** (vectors, iostream, etc.).
* `using namespace std;` â†’ allows us to use names like `vector` and `cout` directly without writing `std::`.

---

```cpp
int main() {
```

* Entry point of the program.

---

```cpp
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
```

* Declares two integers:

  * `n` = number of vertices (nodes).
  * `m` = number of edges.
* Takes input from the user.

---

```cpp
    vector<vector<int>> adjList(n + 1);
```

* Creates an **adjacency list** (graph representation).
* `n+1` is used because vertices are assumed to be **1-indexed** (from 1 to n).
* So, `adjList[i]` will hold all neighbors of node `i`.

---

```cpp
    // Input edges
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        int u, v;
        cin >> u >> v;
        adjList[u].push_back(v);
        adjList[v].push_back(u); // if undirected
    }
```

* Loops `m` times (for each edge).
* Reads an edge between vertices `u` and `v`.
* `adjList[u].push_back(v);` â†’ adds `v` as a neighbor of `u`.
* `adjList[v].push_back(u);` â†’ adds `u` as a neighbor of `v` (because the graph is **undirected**).

---

```cpp
    // Output adjacency list
    cout << "Adjacency List:" << endl;
```

* Prints a header line `"Adjacency List:"`.

---

```cpp
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        cout << i << " -> ";
        for (int v : adjList[i]) {
            cout << v << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
```

* Iterates over all vertices `1` to `n`.
* For each vertex `i`:

  * Prints `i -> `
  * Prints all its neighbors (`v` inside `adjList[i]`).
  * Ends the line with `endl`.

---

```cpp
    return 0;
}
```

* Ends the program successfully.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Example Input & Output

**Input:**

```
4 3
1 2
1 3
4 2
```

* `n = 4` (4 vertices).
* `m = 3` (3 edges).
* Edges:

  * (1,2)
  * (1,3)
  * (4,2)

---

**Step by Step Building Adjacency List:**

* Edge (1,2):
  `adjList[1] = {2}, adjList[2] = {1}`
* Edge (1,3):
  `adjList[1] = {2,3}, adjList[3] = {1}`
* Edge (4,2):
  `adjList[4] = {2}, adjList[2] = {1,4}`

---

**Output:**

```
Adjacency List:
1 -> 2 3 
2 -> 1 4 
3 -> 1 
4 -> 2 
```

ðŸ‘‰ Now tell me Shuvo, do you want me to also **draw this graph (with circles & arrows) as a diagram** so you can visualize the adjacency list better?
