Perfect 👍 You want me to **explain line by line with input + output**. Let’s walk through the exact code you shared.

---

# 📌 Code with Explanation + Example Input/Output

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;   // n = number of nodes, m = number of edges

    int adj[1001][1001]; // static 2D array (supports up to 1000 nodes)
    memset(adj, 0, sizeof(adj)); // fill with 0 (means no edges yet)

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        int u, v;
        cin >> u >> v;     // read an edge (u, v)
        adj[u][v] = 1;     // mark edge from u → v
        adj[v][u] = 1;     // also mark v → u (because undirected graph)
    }

    cout << "Adjacency Matrix:\n";
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {      // loop over rows
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {  // loop over columns
            cout << adj[i][j] << " ";   // print connection (0 or 1)
        }
        cout << "\n"; // new line after each row
    }

    return 0;
}
```

# 📌 Example Run

### Input (user enters this in terminal)

```
5 6
1 2
1 3
2 4
3 4
4 5
2 5
```

👉 Explanation of input:

* `5 6` → 5 nodes, 6 edges
* Then 6 edges:

  * `1 2` → edge between node 1 and 2
  * `1 3` → edge between node 1 and 3
  * `2 4` → edge between node 2 and 4
  * `3 4` → edge between node 3 and 4
  * `4 5` → edge between node 4 and 5
  * `2 5` → edge between node 2 and 5

---

### Output (program prints this)

```
Adjacency Matrix:
0 1 1 0 0 
1 0 0 1 1 
1 0 0 1 0 
0 1 1 0 1 
0 1 0 1 0 
```

# 📌 How to Read This Matrix

* Row = source node
* Column = destination node
* `1` means **there is an edge**, `0` means **no edge**

For example:

* Row 1 → `0 1 1 0 0` → Node 1 connects to `2` and `3`.
* Row 2 → `1 0 0 1 1` → Node 2 connects to `1, 4, 5`.
* Row 4 → `0 1 1 0 1` → Node 4 connects to `2, 3, 5`.

⚡ This is the **classic adjacency matrix using arrays**.
👉 Do you also want me to show **the same graph input/output using adjacency list** (so you can compare matrix vs list)?
