Great question ✅
This is the **core difference** between `array` and `vector<vector<int>> arr(3);`.

---

## 🔎 What happens in

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> arr(3);
```

* You told C++: “Make me **3 rows**.”
* So now you have 3 vectors inside:

```
Row0 → [ ]   (empty vector<int>)  
Row1 → [ ]  
Row2 → [ ]
```

👉 **Columns do not exist yet!**
Each row is an **independent vector<int>** that starts **empty**.

---

## 🚫 Why no column?

Because you didn’t say how many elements (columns) per row.
It’s like creating 3 empty boxes:

```
Box0 → { }  
Box1 → { }  
Box2 → { }
```

---

## ✅ How to add columns

### 1. By `push_back()` (grow dynamically)

```cpp
arr[0].push_back(10);   // Row0 → [10]
arr[0].push_back(20);   // Row0 → [10,20]
arr[1].push_back(5);    // Row1 → [5]
```

Now:

```
Row0 → [10, 20]  
Row1 → [5]  
Row2 → [ ]
```

---

### 2. By `resize()` (predefine column count)

```cpp
arr[0].resize(4);   // Row0 → [0,0,0,0]
arr[0][2] = 99;     // Row0 → [0,0,99,0]
```

---

## ✅ Compare with Array

### Static array

```cpp
int arr[3][4];  // always 3 rows, 4 cols
```

Layout:

```
Row0 → [?,?,?,?]  
Row1 → [?,?,?,?]  
Row2 → [?,?,?,?]
```

### Vector of vectors

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> arr(3);   // 3 rows, 0 cols each
```

Layout:

```
Row0 → [ ]  
Row1 → [ ]  
Row2 → [ ]
```

👉 Columns must be **added manually**.

---

⚡So final answer:
`vector<vector<int>> arr(3);` = 3 rows created, but **each row has 0 columns** (empty).
Columns appear only when you **push\_back()** or **resize()** a row.

---

Do you want me to also show **input/output example with arr(3)** so you see how rows/columns grow step by step during input?
