Absolutely! Let’s go **step by step** — from **algorithm** → **code** → **line-by-line explanation** → **input/output example** — using `vector<vector<int>>` for graph representation.

---

# 🎯 GOAL:
Read a graph from user input (undirected), store it using **adjacency list with vector of vectors**, then print the graph.

---

# ✅ STEP 1: ALGORITHM — GRAPH INPUT & OUTPUT

### 🧠 Algorithm Steps:

1. **Ask user for number of nodes (N)**  
   → We’ll create `N+1` rows (to support 1-based or 0-based indexing).

2. **Ask user for number of edges (M)**

3. **Create adjacency list**:  
   → `vector<vector<int>> adj(N + 1);`  
   → This creates N+1 empty lists (one per node).

4. **For each edge**:  
   a. Read two nodes `u` and `v` (connected by an edge).  
   b. Add `v` to `adj[u]` (u is connected to v).  
   c. Add `u` to `adj[v]` (v is connected to u) → because graph is undirected.

5. **Print the adjacency list**:  
   → For each node from 0 to N, print its neighbor list.

# ✅ STEP 2: CODE WITH LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>        // Required for vector
using namespace std;     // Avoid writing std:: every time

int main() {
    // STEP 1: Declare variables for nodes and edges
    int nodes, edges;
    
    // STEP 2: Input number of nodes
    cout << "Enter number of nodes: ";
    cin >> nodes;  // e.g., if nodes = 4, we'll handle nodes 0,1,2,3,4 (if 1-based)

    // STEP 3: Create adjacency list with nodes+1 empty rows
    // Why nodes+1? → To allow 1-based indexing (node 1 to node N) OR to include node 0 to N
    vector<vector<int>> adj(nodes + 1);  // Creates (nodes+1) empty vector<int>s

    // STEP 4: Input number of edges
    cout << "Enter number of edges: ";
    cin >> edges;

    // STEP 5: Input each edge and build the graph
    cout << "Enter " << edges << " edges (u v):" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < edges; i++) {
        int u, v;
        cin >> u >> v;   // Read connected nodes

        // Add edge in both directions (undirected graph)
        adj[u].push_back(v);   // v is neighbor of u
        adj[v].push_back(u);   // u is neighbor of v
    }

    // STEP 6: Output the adjacency list
    cout << "\n--- Adjacency List ---" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i <= nodes; i++) {        // Loop from node 0 to node 'nodes'
        cout << "Node " << i << " -> ";       // Print node label
        for (int j = 0; j < adj[i].size(); j++) {  // Loop through all neighbors
            cout << adj[i][j];                // Print neighbor
            if (j < adj[i].size() - 1) cout << " "; // Space between, no space at end
        }
        cout << endl;  // New line after each node's list
    }

    return 0;  // End of program
}
```

# ✅ STEP 3: SAMPLE INPUT & OUTPUT

### 🖥️ Input:

```
Enter number of nodes: 4
Enter number of edges: 4
Enter 4 edges (u v):
0 1
0 2
1 3
2 4
```

### 🖨️ Output:

```
--- Adjacency List ---
Node 0 -> 1 2
Node 1 -> 0 3
Node 2 -> 0 4
Node 3 -> 1
Node 4 -> 2
```

✅ This means:
- Node 0 is connected to 1 and 2.
- Node 1 is connected to 0 and 3.
- Node 2 is connected to 0 and 4.
- Node 3 is connected to 1.
- Node 4 is connected to 2.

# ✅ STEP 4: LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION (Key Lines)

| Line | Code | Explanation |
|------|------|-------------|
| 1 | `#include <vector>` | Include vector library to use dynamic arrays |
| 2 | `using namespace std;` | Lets you write `vector` instead of `std::vector` |
| 6 | `int nodes, edges;` | Declare variables to store graph size |
| 9 | `cin >> nodes;` | Read how many nodes in graph (e.g., 4) |
| 13 | `vector<vector<int>> adj(nodes + 1);` | ✅ **Most important line** — creates 5 empty lists for nodes 0,1,2,3,4 |
| 17 | `cin >> edges;` | Read number of connections (edges) |
| 22 | `cin >> u >> v;` | Read two connected nodes |
| 25-26 | `adj[u].push_back(v); adj[v].push_back(u);` | ✅ Add connection both ways (undirected graph) |
| 31 | `for (int i = 0; i <= nodes; i++)` | Loop through all nodes (0 to N) |
| 33 | `for (int j = 0; j < adj[i].size(); j++)` | Loop through all neighbors of node `i` |
| 34 | `cout << adj[i][j];` | Print the neighbor |

# ✅ BONUS: What if you want 1-based indexing?

Sometimes graphs are given with nodes 1 to N (not 0 to N-1). That’s why we do `nodes + 1`.

### Example: Nodes = 4 → we create indexes 0,1,2,3,4 → but use only 1,2,3,4.

Input:
```
Enter number of nodes: 4
Enter edges:
1 2
2 3
3 4
```

Output:
```
Node 1 -> 2
Node 2 -> 1 3
Node 3 -> 2 4
Node 4 -> 3
```

✅ Works perfectly! Index 0 remains empty — no problem.

# ✅ VISUAL REPRESENTATION

For input:
```
Nodes: 4
Edges: 0-1, 0-2, 1-3, 2-4
```

Graph:
```
    0
   / \
  1   2
  |   |
  3   4
```

Adjacency List:
```
0 → [1, 2]
1 → [0, 3]
2 → [0, 4]
3 → [1]
4 → [2]
```

# ✅ WHY USE VECTOR HERE?

| Feature | Array | Vector |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Dynamic Size | ❌ No | ✅ Yes — neighbors can grow |
| Jagged Rows | ❌ No — fixed columns | ✅ Yes — each node has different # of neighbors |
| Memory Waste | ✅ High (if max neighbors unknown) | ❌ None — allocates only what’s needed |
| Easy to Code | ❌ Manual size tracking | ✅ Just `.push_back()` |

---

# ✅ FINAL TIP:

This structure (`vector<vector<int>> adj(n+1)`) is the **standard way to represent graphs** in competitive programming and interviews.

Once you master this, you can easily do:
- BFS / DFS
- Shortest Path (Dijkstra)
- Cycle Detection
- Topological Sort
- And more!

---

✅ You now understand:
- How to declare a graph using vector of vectors.
- How to input edges.
- How to output adjacency list.
- Why it’s better than arrays.
