Absolutely! Let‚Äôs illustrate the difference **visually** using ASCII diagrams. We'll assume the same graph from before:

**Graph input (`input.txt`):**

```
4 4
1 2
1 3
2 4
3 4
```

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Adjacency Matrix**

Code:

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> graph(nodes + 1, vector<int>(nodes + 1, 0));
```

**Meaning:**

* Square matrix of size `(nodes+1) √ó (nodes+1)`
* `graph[u][v] = 1` if there is an edge from `u` to `v`

**ASCII representation (output):**

```
Adjacency Matrix:
    1 2 3 4
1:  0 1 1 0
2:  1 0 0 1
3:  1 0 0 1
4:  0 1 1 0
```

‚úÖ Explanation:

* Row = source node
* Column = destination node
* `1` = edge exists, `0` = no edge

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Adjacency List**

Code:

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> adj(nodes + 1);
```

**Meaning:**

* Each index `i` holds a **vector of neighbors** of node `i`
* No need to store zeros for non-edges ‚Üí memory efficient

**ASCII representation (output):**

```
Adjacency List:
1: 2 3
2: 1 4
3: 1 4
4: 2 3
```

‚úÖ Explanation:

* Node `1` connects to `2` and `3`
* Node `2` connects to `1` and `4`, etc.
* Only stores actual edges

### üîπ Visual Comparison

```
Matrix (all edges explicit):
     1 2 3 4
1:   0 1 1 0
2:   1 0 0 1
3:   1 0 0 1
4:   0 1 1 0

List (edges only):
1 -> 2, 3
2 -> 1, 4
3 -> 1, 4
4 -> 2, 3
```

---

If you want, I can draw a **full ASCII ‚Äúgraph diagram‚Äù next to both adjacency matrix and adjacency list** so you can **see edges visually and how they map to each representation**.

Do you want me to do that?
