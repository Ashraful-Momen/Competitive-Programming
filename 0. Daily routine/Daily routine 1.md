Got it ✅ — you now want the **full merged 2.5-month roadmap (≈75 days)** that includes not just **Graphs + DP**, but also the **core CS fundamentals** you mentioned:

* **Recursion (top-down, bottom-up)**
* **Sorting (Quick Sort, Merge Sort)**
* **Stacks & Queues**
* **Trees & Binary Trees**
* **Linked List (all variants)**

I’ll extend your earlier **60-day Graph+DP plan into a 75-day CS+Algo Mastery Routine**, 1 hour per day.

* **Day 4:** Recursion with memoization → LeetCode 70
* **Day 5:** Recursion to DP conversion → Fibonacci, climbing stairs
* **Day 6:** Backtracking basics → LeetCode 46 (Permutations)
* **Day 7:** Review

---

### **Week 2 – Sorting Algorithms**

* **Day 8:** Merge Sort (concept + implementation) → practice arrays
* **Day 9:** Quick Sort (random pivot, partitioning) → implement
* **Day 10:** Sorting with recursion vs iterative
* **Day 11:** Counting Sort / Radix Sort basics
* **Day 12:** Sorting interview problems → LeetCode 912
* **Day 13:** Merge Intervals (application) → LeetCode 56
* **Day 14:** Review

---

### **Week 3 – Linked List + Stack + Queue**

* **Day 15:** Singly Linked List → LeetCode 206 (Reverse LL)
* **Day 16:** Doubly Linked List → design + practice
* **Day 17:** Cycle detection (Floyd’s) → LeetCode 141
* **Day 18:** Merge two sorted LL → LeetCode 21
* **Day 19:** Stack basics → LeetCode 20 (Valid Parentheses)
* **Day 20:** Queue basics → LeetCode 622 (Circular Queue)
* **Day 21:** Monotonic Stack → LeetCode 739 (Daily Temperatures)

---

## 📅 **Phase 1: Graphs (Day 16–45)**

*(your original Graph section, now shifted forward)*

* **Weeks 4–7 → BFS/DFS, shortest paths (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, FW), MST (Kruskal, Prim), SCC (Kosaraju/Tarjan), Topological Sort, Bridges, Euler, Hamiltonian, review + practice contests**

---

## 📅 **Phase 2: Dynamic Programming (Day 46–75)**

*(your original DP section, extended to cover more basics)*

* **Weeks 8–11 → Classical DP, Knapsack family, Sequence DP (LIS, LCS, Edit Distance, Palindrome), Tree DP, DAG DP, Interval DP, Bitmask DP, Digit DP, Advanced (CHT), final AtCoder DP contest practice**

---

## 🔑 Daily Routine (1 hr/day)

* **10 min** → Review theory/notes from yesterday
* **40 min** → Solve 1–2 problems (easy→medium→hard)
* **10 min** → Editorial review + write takeaway notes

---

✅ After **75 days (2.5 months)** you will:

* Have a solid **foundation (Recursion, Sorting, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Trees)**
* Master **all Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, Shortest paths, MST, SCC, TopoSort, Bridges, Euler/Hamiltonian, connectivity)**
* Master **Dynamic Programming (Knapsack → Trees → Bitmask → Digit → Advanced optimization)**
* Solve **150+ structured problems (LeetCode, UVA, Codeforces, AtCoder)**
* Be fully interview & contest-ready 🚀
