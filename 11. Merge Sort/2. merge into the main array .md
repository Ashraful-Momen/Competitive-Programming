Great question! This line is **crucial** to understanding how we copy the merged result back into the original array. Let's break it down **very clearly**, step by step, with a **concrete example** and **ASCII diagrams**.

---

### 🔍 The Line in Question:

```cpp
for (int i = low; i <= high; i++) {
    arr[i] = temp[i - low];    // i-low maps [low..high] → [0..temp.size()-1]
}
```

### 🎯 Goal:
We want to copy the sorted elements from the temporary array `temp` back into the original array `arr`, but only in the range `[low..high]`.

But here's the catch:
- `temp` starts at index `0`
- `arr` we are updating from index `low` to `high`

So we need to **map**:
```
arr[low]     ← temp[0]
arr[low+1]   ← temp[1]
arr[low+2]   ← temp[2]
    ...           ...
arr[high]    ← temp[high - low]
```

That’s exactly what `i - low` does!

---

### 🧠 Let's Use a Concrete Example

Suppose:
```cpp
arr = [99, 99, 3, 1, 4, 2, 99, 99]
               ↑        ↑
             low=2     high=5
```

We are merging the subarray `[3, 1, 4, 2]` (indices 2 to 5).

After sorting this part using `merge`, `temp` becomes:
```cpp
temp = [1, 2, 3, 4]   ← sorted version of [3,1,4,2]
       ↑  ↑  ↑  ↑
       0  1  2  3
```

Now we want to copy this back into `arr[2..5]`.

We run the loop:

```cpp
for (int i = low; i <= high; i++) {
    arr[i] = temp[i - low];
}
```

Let’s go through each iteration:

| `i` | `i - low` | `temp[i - low]` | `arr[i] = ?`         | Explanation |
|-----|-----------|------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| 2   | 2 - 2 = 0 | `temp[0] = 1`    | `arr[2] = 1`           | First element |
| 3   | 3 - 2 = 1 | `temp[1] = 2`    | `arr[3] = 2`           | Second |
| 4   | 4 - 2 = 2 | `temp[2] = 3`    | `arr[4] = 3`           | Third |
| 5   | 5 - 2 = 3 | `temp[3] = 4`    | `arr[5] = 4`           | Fourth |

✅ After the loop:
```cpp
arr = [99, 99, 1, 2, 3, 4, 99, 99]
               ↑  ↑  ↑  ↑
             [2][3][4][5] ← updated!
```

✔️ The segment is now sorted!

### 🖼️ ASCII Diagram: Index Mapping

```
Original indices in arr:     ...  2    3    4    5  ...
                                   ↓    ↓    ↓    ↓
We want to fill:            [ ?,   ?,   ?,   ?,   ? ]   ← arr[2..5]

From temp:                  [  1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4  ]
                              ↑    ↑    ↑    ↑
                             [0]  [1]  [2]  [3]
                              ↑    ↑    ↑    ↑
Index in temp:             i-low  ↓    ↓    ↓
                            2-2  3-2  4-2  5-2
                             =0   =1   =2   =3
```

So:
- `i - low` **translates** the global index `i` into a **local index** in `temp`.

---

### ❓ Why Not Just Use `temp[i]`?

Because `temp` is a **small vector** that only holds the merged elements, starting at index `0`.

If you did:
```cpp
arr[i] = temp[i];  // ❌ WRONG!
```
Then when `i = 2`, it would try to access `temp[2]` — which might exist, but when `i = 10`, `temp[10]` is out of bounds!

Even worse: `low` could be 1000, but `temp` only has 10 elements.

So we **must** shift the index using `i - low`.

---

### ✅ Summary

| Part | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| `i = low` | Start at the beginning of the segment |
| `i <= high` | Go up to the end |
| `temp[i - low]` | Access the correct element in `temp` |
| `arr[i] = ...` | Put it back in the right place |

🔁 This loop ensures we **safely and correctly** copy the merged result back into the original array.

---

### 💡 Tip: Think of `i - low` as "how far are we from the start?"

Just like:
- If you're in a race and start at mile 2, then:
  - At mile 2 → you've gone 0 miles (`2 - 2`)
  - At mile 5 → you've gone 3 miles (`5 - 2`)

Same idea!
