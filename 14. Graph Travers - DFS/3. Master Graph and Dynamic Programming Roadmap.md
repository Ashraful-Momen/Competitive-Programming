Excellent goal 🚀 — mastering **BFS, DFS, Graphs, and Dynamic Programming (DP)** means you’ll unlock a huge part of **competitive programming, interviews, and system design algorithms**. Let me build you a **step-by-step syllabus (like a full course roadmap)** that takes you from basics → mastery.

# 📘 Roadmap: Mastering BFS, DFS, Graphs + Dynamic Programming

---

## **Phase 1: Core Foundations**

Before graph and DP mastery, you need some fundamentals:

1. **Mathematical Foundations**

   * Sets, relations, functions
   * Combinatorics basics (nCr, permutations)
   * Modular arithmetic (mod, power, gcd/lcm, modular inverse)

2. **Programming Primitives for Graphs + DP**

   * Arrays, vectors, lists
   * Recursion + iterative thinking
   * Stacks & queues
   * Hash maps / sets
   * Priority Queue (min-heap, max-heap)

3. **Graph Representations**

   * **Adjacency Matrix** vs **Adjacency List**
   * Edge list representation
   * Weighted vs unweighted graphs
   * Directed vs undirected

---

## **Phase 2: Master BFS & DFS**

These are the “entry gates” into graph theory.

🔹 **Step 1: BFS (Breadth-First Search)**

* Implement BFS using queue (level by level)
* Shortest path in **unweighted graph**
* Connected components (undirected graphs)
* Detect cycle (using parent in BFS)
* Bipartite check with BFS

🔹 **Step 2: DFS (Depth-First Search)**

* Recursive DFS + Iterative DFS (stack)
* Connected components with DFS
* Cycle detection (directed vs undirected)
* Topological sorting (using DFS postorder)
* Strongly Connected Components (Kosaraju / Tarjan’s Algorithm)

🔹 **Step 3: BFS vs DFS Usage**

* BFS → shortest paths in unweighted graphs
* DFS → path existence, cycle detection, tree traversals

👉 Practice: **LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces basic graph problems**

---

## **Phase 3: Advanced Graph Algorithms**

Now expand BFS + DFS into more powerful algorithms.

1. **Shortest Path Algorithms**

   * BFS (unweighted)
   * Dijkstra’s Algorithm (weighted, no negative)
   * Bellman-Ford (negative weights)
   * Floyd-Warshall (all-pairs shortest path)
   * Johnson’s Algorithm

2. **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**

   * Kruskal’s Algorithm (Union-Find/DSU needed)
   * Prim’s Algorithm (Priority Queue)

3. **Flow Algorithms**

   * Max Flow: Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp
   * Min Cut (Max Flow - Min Cut theorem)

4. **Advanced Topics**

   * LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor)
   * Binary Lifting
   * Euler Tour (Tree flattening for queries)
   * Bridges & Articulation Points (Tarjan’s algorithm)
   * Topological ordering (Kahn’s algorithm BFS)
   * Graph coloring

## **Phase 4: Dynamic Programming (DP)**

DP is where BFS/DFS intuition + recursion pay off.

🔹 **Step 1: Foundations**

* Recursion → Memoization → Tabulation
* Common patterns:

  * **1D DP**: Fibonacci, climbing stairs
  * **2D DP**: grid paths, unique paths, min cost path
  * **DP with States**: knapsack, coin change
* Transition equations (recurrence relations)

🔹 **Step 2: DP on Sequences**

* Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
* Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
* Edit Distance
* Partition problems

🔹 **Step 3: DP on Trees (DFS + DP)**

* Tree DP (subtree sum, maximum independent set on tree)
* Rerooting technique

🔹 **Step 4: DP on Graphs**

* DP with topological ordering (DAGs)
* DP + shortest paths
* Bitmask DP (Traveling Salesman Problem, Hamiltonian path)

🔹 **Step 5: Advanced DP**

* Digit DP
* DP with matrix exponentiation
* DP optimization techniques:

  * Divide & Conquer DP
  * Convex Hull Trick
  * Knuth Optimization

## **Phase 5: Problem-Solving Strategy**

1. **Classify problems**: Is it BFS/DFS, Shortest Path, or DP?
2. **Identify constraints**: N ≤ 10^5 → BFS/DFS/Dijkstra; N ≤ 20 → Bitmask DP
3. **Break down into subproblems**
4. **Write recurrence / state transition**
5. **Optimize memory and time**

## **Daily Routine to Master**

* 📖 **1 hr**: Theory (one new concept)
* 💻 **2 hrs**: Solve 2–3 problems (easy → medium → hard gradually)
* 📝 **30 min**: Revise previous concepts, maintain notes
* 🔁 Repeat until concepts → intuition
