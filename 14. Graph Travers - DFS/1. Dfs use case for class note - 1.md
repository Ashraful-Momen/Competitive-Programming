Great question 🚀 Let’s break it down.

### 🔹 What is the name of the DFS here?

The function is named **`dfs`** (Depth First Search).

It is a **graph traversal algorithm** that goes **as deep as possible** along each branch before backtracking.
In your code, DFS is written in **recursive form**.

### 🔹 Where is it used in this code?

Your `dfs()` is used to **traverse a 2D grid (matrix)**.
Here, the grid is treated as a graph:

* Each **cell** = a node.
* A **connection** exists if you can move **up, down, left, or right** into a valid neighboring cell that contains `1`.

This specific DFS is used for **exploring connected components** in the matrix (like finding islands in a grid).

### 🔹 Real-world uses of DFS

DFS is very widely used:

1. **Grid/Matrix problems**:

   * Count number of islands in a map 🌍
   * Solve mazes 🌀
   * Flood-fill (like paint bucket tool 🎨 in Photoshop)

2. **Graph problems**:

   * Detect cycles
   * Topological sort
   * Connected components
   * Path finding

3. **Tree problems**:

   * Inorder / Preorder / Postorder traversal
   * Checking if two trees are identical
   * Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)

✅ In your code:

* `dfs(0, 0, n, m, isVisited, grid);`
  Starts DFS from the top-left cell `(0,0)` and visits all reachable `1`s connected to it.
